The Standard The goal of this guide is to ensure that all pages are as similar and easy to use as possible. The conventions laid out below have been chosen for cleanliness and best practice. There are other ways of writing markdown, but these ones are preferred. Verbiage Your content is worded definitely in the present tense. There is no ambiguity, and terminology is clinical. Procedures are numbered and tractable. Assumptions are also never made, with exception of some basics: ops-misc is properly configured.

Headings The ATX method of headings is used exclusively. The first line of every page is an H1 title.

There must only be one H1 (title) per page. # Heading 1 (Title) ## Heading 2 ### Heading 3 #### Heading 4 Lists Both ordered and unordered lists are indented by four spaces between levels.
